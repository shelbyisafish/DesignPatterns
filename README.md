# DesignPatterns

I'm using Visual Studio Community 2019 to build this project.

To run the program, set "DesignPatternsConsole" as the startup project. (In Visual Studio, Right click the project > Set at Startup Project)

I'll be building the design patterns in this order:

Creatioinal:
  1. Singleton
  2. Builder
  3. Factory Method
  4. Abstract Factory
  5. Prototype

Behavioral: TBD

Structural: TBD
